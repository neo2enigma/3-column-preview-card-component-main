## My process
First I started to understand the layout and break each part to a section. It is essential to think modular in a way to prevent dublication in css. This mean you have pollute css file.
In the next step, I wrote HTML. For css part, I started from the very top element and finally reached to inner one.
The best way is to create the main structure and later on make yourself busy with decoration and color.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I revised my css and HTML to times. I found that modular thinking and DRY pattern even in css are applicable.
